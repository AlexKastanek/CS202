Observations:
1. My first observation was the order of inheritance. Whenever a rectangular prism or cylinder are constructed, the classes they are inherited from are also constructed, but rectangular prism and cylinder are derived from those constructions.
2. My second observation was how when I create a shape, and use a shape pointer, it affects the derived class objects like rectangle and circle. This is because the classes are derived from shape and therefore share some data.
3. My third observation was that a list of shapes could actually be a list of a mix of rectangles, circles, rectangular prisms, and cylinders because they are all derived from each other.
